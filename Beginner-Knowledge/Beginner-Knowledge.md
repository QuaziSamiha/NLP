### Mulberry Domain

- can be done `Classification` (can combine multiple data set)
- can be done `Detection` and `Segmentation` --> need annotation

- lacking:
  - diseases can be seasonal but leaves are collected during 6 months only, so other season diseases can be missed
  - this is a classification task, there are 3 classes, and the model only one class at a time, but a leaf can attacked by multiple diseases. so multiclass classification can be done.

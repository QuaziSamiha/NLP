## Abstract

Charts are widely used to analyze data and answer questions. Recently, tasks like chart question-answering and summarization have gained attention. Existing methods usually fine-tune models designed for vision or language tasks, but these are limited to specific tasks.

To address this, the researchers created **ChartInstruct**, a dataset with 191,000 instructions from 71,000 charts, designed for teaching models how to work with charts. They developed two systems:

1. **End-to-end model**: Combines a chart image processor with a language model.
2. **Pipeline model**: Extracts chart data into tables first, then uses a language model for reasoning.

These systems achieved top results on multiple tasks and showed the ability to handle many real-world chart-related problems, making them more versatile than previous models.

#### Simple Definitions:

1. **Fine-tuning**:

   - Teaching an existing AI model to perform a specific task by training it on new, smaller datasets related to that task.
   - Example: A general language model fine-tuned on medical text to answer health-related questions.

2. **Instruction Tuning**:

   - Training a model to follow specific types of instructions by providing examples of tasks in a structured way.
   - Example: Teaching a model to answer questions, summarize, or explain charts based on given prompts.

3. **End-to-End Model**:

   - A single system that handles everything from start to finish.
   - Example: Taking a chart image, understanding it, and directly generating a response in one process.

4. **Pipeline Model**:

   - A multi-step system where each step does a specific task in sequence.
   - Example: First extract data from a chart into a table, then process the table to answer questions.

5. **Vision Encoder**:
   - A tool that helps a model "see" and understand images (like charts or photos) by converting visual information into a format the model can use.
   - Example: Recognizing chart elements like bars, lines, or labels.

In short: Fine-tuning and instruction tuning are ways to customize models for tasks. End-to-end models are all-in-one solutions, while pipeline models break tasks into steps. A vision encoder helps models understand images.

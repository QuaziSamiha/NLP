- **idea** : "A robust `explainable framework` for detecting abusive language using a combination of `data mining` and `NLP techniques`." - Here we use NLP technique for `preprocess`. Then we will use `clustering` for detecting abusive and non-abusive language. Then we will use `classification model` and will focus of precision to mitigate `false negative`. We will propose the model which will provide good performance. Then we will implement `explainable techniques` to explain `locally` and `globally` to explain why this model predict `abusive` and `non-abusive` of a particular data.
